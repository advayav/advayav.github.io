                I worked in a group to build a website for the weekly farmer's market at my college. There was a lack of information regarding it
                and our goal was to make it more accessible and easier to attend. The website allowed users to not only gain more information
                but also keep better track of the products and vendors they wanted to visit during the market <br> <br>

                I made this as part of a class I took while at college. It uses signals to send and receive messages between 3 different users.
                While this application is currently to send a fixed message using a fixed user pattern, it can be easily modified to customize
                the message as well as the user the message is being sent to.

                A game I made to help me to take a small break while I am working on my laptop. The game allows the player to generate a grid
                of any size they would like and draw in the boxes!
