        <p class="intro-para">Hi! My name is Advaya Venbakkam. I am currently a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
            graduating in May 2026. I love to combine creativity with my coding projects and so tend to lean more towards Front End Development
            roles since they allow me to have some creative liberty with my work but I am excited to learn more and explore more avenues in Computer Science.
            I enjoy photography, reading, crocheting and am always excited to learn new topics and meet new people!<br>
            Here is a link to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13rXpPrFuUSE6VFCJn_ieeyjgFl_kr5nD/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Resume</a>
